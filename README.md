# police_data_analysis
Explore and visualize crime data in San Francisco with Python. This project uses Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium libraries to analyze and display trends in crime incidents across different police districts and categories. The data contains approximately 1 million records from 2003 to May 2018.

Police Incident Report Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs data analysis on a historical dataset of police incidents in San Francisco from 2003 to May 2018. The dataset contains approximately 1 million records and includes information such as the date and time of the incident, the police district where it occurred, and the type of crime that was committed.

The notebook contains code that uses the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to explore and visualize the data. The main outputs of the analysis are several graphs that help to shed light on the patterns and trends in police incidents over time and across different police districts in San Francisco.

The first graph is a folium choropleth map that shows the number of incidents that occurred in each police district. This helps to give a quick visual representation of which districts are most affected by crime and where more police resources may be needed.

The second graph is a Plotly treemap that drills down further into the data to show the distribution of different types of crime across the police districts. This helps to give a better understanding of the types of crimes that are most prevalent in each district and where the police may need to focus their efforts.

The third graph is a Seaborn facet plot that plots the frequency of incidents over time, broken down by police district. This helps to show how the number of incidents has changed over time in each district and whether there are any trends or patterns in the data.

Finally, the last graph is a Seaborn heatmap that shows the distribution of incidents across the days of the week, broken down by police district. This helps to show when incidents are most likely to occur in each district and which days of the week the police may need to focus their efforts.

Overall, this repository provides a valuable resource for anyone looking to analyze police incident data and gain a deeper understanding of crime patterns and trends in San Francisco.
